While harm reduction coverage for YPWUD is suboptimal globally, in low- and middle-income countries youth-focused harm reduction services are particularly lacking. Harm reduction programs in these countries are often powerfully shaped by global health funding regimes that restrict progressive programming and reach. In this commentary we highlight the efforts of young people, activists, allies, and organisations across some Global South settings to enact programs such as those focused on peer-to-peer information sharing and advocacy, overdose monitoring and response, and drug checking. We draw on our experiential knowledge and expertise to identify and discuss key challenges, opportunities, and recommendations for youth harm reduction movements, programs and practices in low- to middle-income countries and beyond, focusing on the need for youth-driven interventions. We conclude this commentary with several calls to action to advance harm reduction for YPWUD within and across Global South settings.\n\nplain-language-summary: |\n  While young people who use drugs (YPWUD) are increasingly exposed to related social and health harms, YPWUD in low- and middle-income countries from the Global South often face particular challenges and are at increased risk of mortality and morbidity. The sociopolitical environment characteristic of many LWMICs place many harm reduction programs in situations where they are limited by stringent donor funding, lack of skills transfer and up-scaling and structural violence imposed through the \"war on drugs\". Despite these challenges, several success stories exist. \ndate: last-modified\ncss: custom01.css\nbibliography: references.bib\ncitation:\n  container-title: Young People Who Use Drugs\nnumber-sections: true\nalways_allow_html: true\n---\n\n\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn the Global South, young people are often exposed to multiple\ninterconnected social and health harms as a result of the war on drugs\n[@stockings2016; @degenhardt2016; @kimmel2020], with many low- and\nmiddle-income countries imposing racist, classist, and prohibitionist\ndrug policies through a continuum of violence that encompasses physical\nand structural assaults [@daniels2021; @tinasti2018; @duarte2020]. Young\npeople who use drugs (YPWUD) in the context of various intersections of\nage, race, class, gender, sexuality, mental health challenges, and\ninvolvement in criminalized income generation activities such as sex\nwork often experience heightened violence and oppression and worse\nhealth and social outcomes [@jacobs2020; @delatorre-luque2021;\n@tinasti2018; @krug2015]. Despite increasing global coverage of harm\nreduction services, there remains a lack of youth-focused harm reduction\nservices, especially in low- and middle-income countries\n[@colledge-frisby2023]. In general, across these settings, public health\nsystems are often characterized by systemic under investment and\ndeteriorating infrastructures, human resource crises, and corruption\n[@serebryakova2021]. Conflicting public health, international donor\nfunding, and law enforcement agendas impede the implementation of many\nevidence-based harm reduction programs. The criminalization and\nmoralization of drugs and the people who use them powerfully undermines\naccess to those harm reduction services that do exist [@wodak2012;\n@toumbourou2007]. In places where it is possible to access harm\nreduction programs (usually run by non-governmental organizations),\nYPWUD are disproportionately underserved relative to older populations\nin these contexts [@ogundipe2018; @krug2012].\n\nAcross the Global South, the war on drugs is too often a violent,\nracist, and classist war on YPWUD in the context of multiple and\nintersecting forms of oppression and limited access to care\n[@daniels2021] . Yet, YPWUD as well as youth-led and youth-inclusive\norganizations in these settings are actively pioneering harm reduction\nprograms to meet their needs and the needs of their communities\n[@canêdo2022]. This commentary is authored by YPWUD -- past and present\n-- from countries throughout the Global South, alongside academic and\ncommunity allies from low- and middle-income countries as well as higher\nincome countries. We are a heterogeneous group, yet each of us embraces\nharm reduction as a set of ideological principles and pragmatic\nstrategies rooted in social and health justice and a commitment to human\nrights, including the right to health for all people [@pauly2008]. We\nbelieve that harm reduction is characterised by an absence of judgement\ntowards drug use and respect for an individual's choice to use drugs\n[@zampini2018]. Since 2009, the World Health Organisation has provided a\nlist of harm reduction interventions for the prevention, treatment and\ncare of people who inject drugs and are living with or at risk of HIV,\nincluding needle distribution and exchange programs, opioid agonist\ntherapy, and HIV testing and treatment programs\n[@worldhealthorganization2009]. However, we argue that harm reduction\nprogramming for people who use drugs, including YPWUD, must extend\nbeyond HIV prevention, testing and treatment. Programming must include\ninterventions such as the distribution of a range of supplies (not just\nneedles -- for example, safer smoking kits), take-home naloxone\nprograms, drug checking services, drug consumption spaces, and peer-led\ninformation sharing, support, and advocacy. Unfortunately, across many\nGlobal South settings, donor funding has been insufficient to support\nthis kind of comprehensive harm reduction programming, including for\nYPWUD [@serebryakova2021]. We have therefore taken matters into our own\nhands, in some cases despite tremendous risks to our safety and the\nsafety of our communities.\n\nThe purpose of this commentary is to further ignite much needed\nconversations about YPWUD and harm reduction in the Global South. It\ncentres the diverse efforts of young people, activists, allies, and\norganisations across numerous Global South settings to enact programs\nsuch as those focused on peer-to-peer information sharing and advocacy,\noverdose monitoring and response, and drug checking. This is by no means\na comprehensive overview of what is happening when it comes to YPWUD and\nharm reduction in the Global South. So many success stories are missing\nfrom what follows, in part because we struggled to connect -- and stay\nconnected with -- young drug user activists and harm reduction\npractitioners across the globe. These young people are oftentimes\noverworked, overwhelmed, and under compensated as they attempt to keep\nthemselves and their communities safe while under the weight of poverty,\nthe drug war, and other forms of oppression. They may be completely new\nto these kinds of scholarly outputs, and lack access to mentors who are\nable assist with the challenging work of writing (often in a second\nlanguage). The timeline of this kind of work can also be frustrating; a\nlarge investment of time and energy is required, but the rewards of\ncontributing are unclear, especially as time passes and a publication\nhas still not come to fruition. Sharing a number of the harm reduction\nsuccess stories that we were able to collect, we draw on our\nexperiential knowledge and expertise to identify and discuss key\nchallenges, opportunities, and recommendations for youth harm movements,\nprograms and practices in low- to middle-income countries and beyond,\nfocusing on the need for youth-driven healthcare and harm reduction\ninterventions.\n\n## A note on language {#sec-language}\n\nThere are major limitations to the language of both \"young people who\nuse drugs (YPWUD)\" and the \"Global South\" that we employ throughout this\ncommentary. Both terms may ultimately obscure more than they reveal,\nbecause they often seem to place finite boundaries around what in\nreality are much messier social and geographic categories. Definitions\nof \"young people\" and \"youth\" -- and lived experiences of these\ncategories -- vary widely across settings and contexts, where\nintersections of age, gender, sexual orientation, class, race, human\nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV) status, and other dimensions of\npositionality are mediated by particular configurations of power and\npolitical economy to shape these social categories and lived experiences\n[@duarte2020]. Does it make sense to talk about young people and youth\nas those under twenty-four or twenty-nine years of age, when many\nindividuals continue to strongly identify with these categories -- and\nwith youth drug user activism and movements -- well into their thirties,\noften due to entrenched, shared circumstances of precarity as well as\nshared visions for possible solutions [@canêdo2022; @stowe2022]?\nConversely, do age-definitions of young people and youth make sense when\nreferring to those for whom poverty, lack of education, unemployment,\nviolence, migration, HIV, and other difficulties have forced them to\nmove directly from childhood to adulthood, without the possibility of\nexperiencing youth as a period of transition or activism and power\n[@dambruoso2022]? Similarly, it may not make sense to talk about a\nGlobal South composed of countries and regions in Africa, Latin America,\nand parts of Asia that meet certain criteria according to the World Bank\nincome-per-capita index, when many so-called \"Global North\" settings are\nhome to populations experiencing similar levels of entrenched poverty\nand structural oppression, also as a result of historical and ongoing\nprocesses of colonialism and capitalism [@buxton2020]. Recognizing the\nlimitations of this language, in this commentary we have chosen to use\nthe term Global South (rather than listing out a number of discrete\ncountries and regions in various instances) in order to emphasize some\nof the common and disproportionate impacts of the war on drugs on YPWUD\nacross low- and middle-income countries [@buxton2020]. We use the term\nyoung people to mark ourselves out as a unique demographic with specific\nharm reduction priorities, needs, and desires that is simultaneously\ncharacterized by fluidity of meaning and association not necessarily\ndetermined by numerical age.\n\n## Shared Challenges {#sec-challenges}\n\nThere is a severe lack of data on the situation of YPWUD in the Global\nSouth [@doyle2022]. What we do know is that those between the ages of 14\nand 34 account for more than one third of the population in low-income\ncountries, and rates of substance use are high and climbing among this\nage range[@jumbe2021; @david2023]. YPWUD in the Global South are\nvulnerable to a myriad of social and health harms (exacerbated by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic), including blood-borne infections (e.g. HIV, HCV),\nfatal and non-fatal opioid involved overdose, skin and soft tissue\ninfections, police violence and extrajudicial murder and mass\nincarceration [@jumbe2021; @degenhardt2016; @hall2016; @scheim2020].\n\nGlobal coverage of harm reduction interventions is suboptimal , but this\nis particularly the case in lower- and middle-income countries\n[@colledge-frisby2023]. For example, the Global State of Harm Reduction\nReport [@harmreductioninternational2020] highlights that only fourteen\nout of twenty-five countries or regions in these parts of the world have\nexisting needle exchange programs. Countries or regions that do have\nneedle exchange programs generally also provide opioid agonist therapy,\nsuch as methadone. However, even in these settings, life-saving\ninterventions such as drug consumption spaces and take-home naloxone\nprograms remain largely unavailable [@colledge-frisby2023].\n\nAcross Global South settings, YPWUD and the organizations they are a\npart of face particularly dire challenges in implementing much needed\nharm reduction services due to hostile and militarized governments,\nsystemic corruption, violent policing, punitive laws and forced\ntreatment or rehabilitation models, precarious and conditional state and\ninternational funding, and entrenched stigma and oppression\n[@dambruoso2022; @desjarlais2013; @krug2012]. High levels of\nunemployment, poverty, and homelessness often combine with the\ncriminalization of drug use (in some cases via the death penalty and\nextrajudicial killings), sex work, and sexual and gender identities to\nproduce egregious human rights violations and make harm reduction\norganising and action difficult, and sometimes impossible\n[@dambruoso2022; @debeck2017; @rekart2005]. In a system of prohibition,\nthe Global South is also disproportionately impacted by the various\nnegative effects of the global demand for illicit drugs, which\nparticularly impacts countries in Latin America, South East Asia and the\nMiddle East and North Africa, as well as in transit regions such as West\nAfrica [@unodc2022].\n\n## Success Stories {#sec-success}\n\nWhile significant challenges remain for implementing comprehensive harm\nreduction programming for YPWUD across Global South settings\n[@daniels2021; @chang2021], several of us are actively involved in\nimplementing various harm reduction programs in our countries. We share\nthese examples here with the goal of inspiring youth drug user activism\nand meaningful policy and programming change across lower- and\nmiddle-income settings globally.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## East Africa\n\n### Empowering young women who use drugs in East Africa through online networking and peer support\n\nA majority of empowerment efforts directed towards women who use drugs\nare under-resourced, patriarchal, or fail to consider how complex\nintersections of age, gender, class, cultural, and geographic contexts\nshape drug use [@lambdin2013]. In 2022, the community-led organization\nWomen in Response to HIV/AIDS and Drug Addiction (WRADA) set out to\nbuild a network of young women who use drugs in Kenya, Uganda and\nTanzania with support from the International Network of People who use\nDrugs. This multi-year community initiative involves bi-monthly online\npeer support forums using Zoom. Young women meet on Zoom to discuss and\ndocument regional harm reduction challenges and emerging trends in drug\nuse and sex work and develop sexual and reproductive health and harm\nreduction information tailored to their communities. The project fosters\nempowerment by increasing the knowledge, skills and capacities of\nparticipants, growing grassroots harm reduction research and advocacy,\ndeveloping context-driven approaches to promoting human rights, and\nproviding peer mental health support. Despite challenges with internet\nconnectivity and technological know-how among participants, the project\nhas resulted in improved relationships between young women who use drugs\nand local harm reduction programs across East Africa, greater advocacy\nfor adoption of best practices through a peer-to-peer learning model,\nthe generation of more robust evidence for regional harm reduction and\ndrug policy reform, and increased visibility of young women who use\ndrugs in East Africa.\n\n## South Africa\n\n### Distributing take-home naloxone kits and overdose education in South Africa\n\nIn South Africa, YPWUD are an underserved population frequently exposed\nto the social and health harms of HIV and HCV incidence, skin and\nsoft-tissue infection, poverty, unstable housing and homelessness, and\nmultiple forms of physical and structural violence [@dambruoso2022;\n@peltzer2018]. Heroin use and overdose are increasingly common among\nyouth [@harker2020]. While South Africa's essential medicines list\nincludes naloxone for the management of overdose, to date no\nstate-sponsored naloxone distribution programmes exist [@scheibe2020].\nTo improve access to this lifesaving overdose antidote among YPWUD and\nothers, in 2021 the South African Network of People Who Use Drugs\n(SANPUD) piloted the country's first (and to date only) take-home\nnaloxone (THN) program. The program was piloted in Cape Town, Tshwane,\nand eThekwini, with two workshops held in each city over a two-week\nperiod. It involved peer-delivered overdose education, including\npractical training on the administration of naloxone. Participants\nreceived a naloxone kit with four ampoules of naloxone (0.4mg/ 1ml) and\nrequired medical equipment, as well as a step-by-step guide to\nresponding to and managing opioid overdoses. The design of these\nmaterials was informed by several community advisory groups that\nincluded youth-led and -focused groups. During the pilot, three opioid\noverdoses were successfully reversed. Unfortunately, lack of state\nfunding and political buy-in has halted the continuation and expansion\nof the program. However, the success of the pilot represents an\nimportant moment in the fight against racist and violent drug policies\nthat continue to criminalize and disproportionately burden YPWUD, and in\nparticular Black and Brown YPWUD. The successful co-design and delivery\nof a youth-led THN program underscores growing calls for non-restrictive\nstate and NGO funding that can be used to support evidence-based\ninterventions beyond a narrow set of prescriptive interventions and\nprograms (e.g., HIV prevention programs focused on people who inject\ndrugs).\n\n## Nepal\n\n### Training Frontline Workers to Provide Harm Reduction Services to Young People who Inject Drugs in Nepal\n\nIn 2019, a government survey revealed that there are over 130,000 people\nwho use drugs in Nepal, with young people (defined as \\< 30 years of\nage) accounting for more than two-thirds of this figure [@idpc2021].\nYoung people who inject drugs in this setting are disproportionately\nvulnerable to various social, health, and legal harms [@bhandari2021;\n@kakchapati2018]. In response, in 2022 five community organizations (YKP\nLead, Sathi Samuha, Recovering Nepal, Youth RISE, Youth LEAD) came\ntogether to pilot a new training and service delivery project to better\naddress the needs of young people who inject drugs. As a first step,\nfocus group discussions with youth and in-depth interviews with service\nproviders led to the identification of shared problems and possible\nhealthcare and harm reduction-oriented solutions, including the\nidentification of key areas for outreach throughout the Kathmandu\nValley. Using this information, twenty-two service providers from\norganizations providing harm reduction services in Kathmandu valley were\ntrained to better understand how social, cultural, political, economic,\ngeographic and technological contexts affect the practices and service\nneeds of young people who inject drugs in diverse communities.\nContext-informed approaches to care were developed, including online and\npeer-to-peer outreach and counselling, expanded hours of operation for\non-the-ground harm reduction service providers, and better referral\nmechanisms among providers. The findings and recommendations generated\nby the pilot project were later shared with a national audience of\nservice providers and organizations. The pilot project enhanced\nawareness and knowledge among service providers and better equipped them\nwith skills they need to adopt and deliver harm reduction to young\npeople who inject drugs.\n\n## Mexico\n\n### Exchanging Knowledge, Building Advocacy, and Challenging Punitive Drug Policies Among YPWUD in Mexico\n\nIn Mexico, young people are increasingly exposed to the negative impacts\nof the country's militarized and violent approach to addressing drug use\nand trafficking, resulting in regular human rights\nviolations[@hernándezcastillo2019; @morales2020]. Despite these\nconditions, international donor funding continues to support \"tough on\ncrime\" rhetoric and prioritise law enforcement interventions over\nevidenced-based healthcare and harm reduction approaches. In response,\nYPWUD have mobilised to hold the now annual Support Don't Punish\nFestival as a means of regularly engaging with each other, sharing harm\nreduction knowledge and challenging punitive drug policies. The festival\nis held each year on June 26th as a community response to commemorate\nthe UN international day against the illicit trafficking and abuse of\ndrugs. It is delivered by Instituto RIA and ReverdeSer Colectivo and\nprovides a safe, non-judgemental space for young people to fight for\ntheir human rights. Festival activities include youth-led marches, harm\nreduction information booths, showcases of youth entrepreneurship, and\nperformances by bands opposed to the oppression of YPWUD. During the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, the festival transitioned to a virtual event,\nexpanding its reach to include multiple countries. Throughout the rest\nof the year, the festival also organizes other activities around the\ncountry, such as collective murals, art exhibits, social media content,\nand harm reduction information materials, including entertaining videos\npromoting drug use best practices. The Support Don't Punish Festival has\nbecome a vital platform for harm reduction knowledge exchange, advocacy\nand challenging punitive drug policies among YPWUD in Mexico and beyond.\n\n## Columbia\n\n### Drug checking services in Colombia {#sec-drug-checking}\n\nDrug checking services in Colombia have been implemented to decrease\nexposure to the growing harms associated with an unregulated drug\nsupply. In general, drug checking services have multiple aims: to\nconduct chemical analysis of substances of submitted directly by the\npublic; to return results to the service user; to provide a platform for\ntailored (rather than general) information exchange between service\nusers and the service; and to ultimately reduce harms [@barratt2022].\nAlthough reducing drug-related harm via changes in drug using practices\nat the point of consumption is key to the success of drug checking,\nthese services are also highly valued for generating real-time\ninformation about drug market trends that can be actioned rapidly via\ntext message and social media alerts [@brien2023]. With volunteers and\nharm reduction experts located in Bogotá, Medellin, and Cali, the\nnon-governmental organization Acción Técnica Social implemented a drug\nchecking service beginning in 2013 through a project entitled Échele\nCabeza Cuando se de en la Cabeza (EC; translated as Use Your Head Before\nIt Goes to Your Head) [@díazmoreno2022]. Since its inception, EC has\ninvolved YPWUD and used innovative harm reduction communication\nstrategies to promote self- and community-care: protests, street art,\nposters, handouts, flyers, videos, memes, and perhaps most importantly,\nmaintaining a significant presence on social media. EC began by offering\ndrug checking services on-site at raves, festivals, and nightlife\nevents; in 2016, fixed-site drug checking services were introduced\n[@díazmoreno2022]. Wherever drug checking services are provided, YPWUD\nare provided with tailored information and support backed by scientific\nevidence. Based on the testing done across these settings, EC regularly\nposts to social media about substances, test results, and alerts,\nsupporting real time dissemination of critical harm reduction\ninformation. EC has demonstrated the importance of monitoring the drug\nmarket and building online and in-person networks with people who use\ndrugs, including YPWUD. Unfortunately, despite the effectiveness of this\nprogram and some support from the Mayor's Office of Bogotá and the\nColumbian Drug Observatory, financial restrictions continue to limit the\nreach of the program [@díazmoreno2022].\n:::\n\n## Calls to Action\n\nDrawing on our discussion of shared and challenges and success stories,\nwe conclude by putting forward seven key recommendations to advance harm\nreduction for YPWUD within and across Global South settings:\n\n1.  YPWUD from across the global south must be meaningfully involved in\n    harm reduction policy, programming, and activism. We should be at\n    the table with government (when this is possible) as well as\n    non-governmental organizations and donors when decisions are being\n    made. All of the success stories detailed above demonstrate that our\n    participation is essential to the development of tailored,\n    context-responsive, and effective services and programs that promote\n    equity and uphold human rights.\n2.  Governments and non-governmental organizations in low- and\n    middle-income countries should regularly collect accurate data on\n    drug use patterns, including patterns among YPWUD, and use that data\n    to inform harm reduction policy, practice, and programming. For\n    example, at present, the Government of Nepal only collects data once\n    every five to six years, limiting the relevance of this data to\n    policy and practice. Yet, the pilot project described above\n    demonstrates how up to date information gleaned through focus groups\n    and in-depth interviews facilitates the development and adaptation\n    of effective harm reduction services.\n3.  Financial resources, including international donor and domestic\n    funding, must be shifted from punitive law enforcement and drug\n    supply reduction towards a continuum of community-based,\n    evidence-informed online and on-the-ground harm reduction services,\n    including peer-to-peer information generating and sharing programs\n    and advocacy networks, take-home naloxone programs, drug checking\n    services, and drug consumption spaces.\n4.  Government, non-governmental organization, and international donor\n    funding focused on harm reduction should be less ties to a narrow\n    set of prescriptive interventions and programs (e.g., HIV prevention\n    programs focused on people who inject drugs), in order to better\n    support the diverse efforts of YPWUD and youth-led and -inclusive\n    community organizations to meet their harm reduction needs.\n5.  Too often, promising pilot projects end because of a lack of\n    sustained funding. Government, non-governmental organizations,\n    international donors, and civil society should work to identify and\n    scale up promising pilot projects undertaken by and with YPWUD. The\n    focus of those providing funding should be on what is happening and\n    working on the ground -- and online -- among YPWUD. Recognize that\n    funding these projects may produce better results than campaigns and\n    programs that are overly general and imposed from the top down.\n6.  Towards this end, there must be better coordination and\n    collaboration between government, non-governmental organizations,\n    international donors, and civil society.\n7.  There must be greater efforts to build capacity among YPWUD in the\n    global south to undertake harm reduction-focused research, including\n    the evaluation of their own programs. Many YPWUD and their mentors\n    have tremendous experiential knowledge regarding drug use and harm\n    reduction programs, practices, and needs in their communities, but\n    lack the ability to translate that knowledge into traditional\n    scholarly outputs, including peer-reviewed publications and grants.\n    Those conducting funded research -- and building their careers -- in\n    these settings who do have these skills, namely, many academics\n    based in Northern universities, must commit to doing some of this\n    capacity building work together with YPWUD. This can take the form\n    of an investment of significant time: co-authoring publications and\n    grants (as author Danya Fast did with this piece).
